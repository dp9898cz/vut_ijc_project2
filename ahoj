I have seen many posts but didn't find something like i want.
I am getting wrong output :

ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ......  // may be this is EOF character
Going into infinite loop.

My algorithm:

Go to end of file.
decrease position of pointer by 1 and read character by character.
exit if we found our 10 lines or we reach beginning of file.
now i will scan the full file till EOF and print them //not implemented in code.
code:

#include<iostream>
#include<stdio.h>
#include<conio.h>
#include<stdlib.h>
#include<string.h>

using namespace std;
int main()
{
    FILE *f1=fopen("input.txt","r");
    FILE *f2=fopen("output.txt","w");
    int i,j,pos;
        int count=0;
        char ch;
        int begin=ftell(f1);
        // GO TO END OF FILE
